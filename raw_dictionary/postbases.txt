The following postbases, -li-, -liaq, –linqigte-, -linraq*, -liqe-1, -liqe-2, -lir-, -liur-, -liyar-, start with li and
drop the final consonant of the base to which they are attached. With such postbases it is generally permissible to
delete the l of the postbase and the preceding vowel after the postbase has been attached. For example, angyaliuq ‘he
is making a boat’ can be shortened to angyiuq. In some cases, however, the shortened form is not acceptable to all
speakers. In other cases the shortened form is preferred to the longer form, and in some cases the shortened form has
acquired a meaning slightly different from that of the longer form. This is particularly true of -li- and -lir-; for this
reason, the shortened forms -i- and -ir- are listed as postbases in their own right.

@~+ni- to say or claim that oneself or another is V-ing # this is a “compound verbal postbase,” as are -cete-1,
-cetaar-, -sqe-, -vkar-, -ciite-, -staili-, -nayuke-, -yuke-, and -rqe-2; the remarks on polarity concerning this
base consequently apply to the other compound verbal postbases as well; see also Practical Grammar of . . .
Yup’ik (p. 322ff); < -niThere are four possible polarity combinations:
1) Embedded verb considered intransitive; derived verb used with an intransitive ending; in this case the subject of
the derived verb ‘claims’ (‘causes’, ‘wants’, or ‘believes’, etc., with the other compound verbal postbases) that he
himself is the subject of the embedded verb:
tangvag- ‘to watch’

tangvagniuq ‘he says that he (himself) is watching’

pinir- ‘to be strong’

pinirniuq ‘he says that he (himself) is strong’

2) Embedded verb considered intransitive; derived verb used with a transitive ending; in this case, the subject of
the derived verb ‘claims’ that the object of the derived verb is the subject of the embedded verb:
tangvag- ‘to watch’

tangvagnia ‘he says that he (another) is watching’

pinir- ‘to be strong’

pinirnia ‘he says that he (another) is strong’

3) Embedded verb considered transitive; derived verb used with an intransitive ending; in this case the subject of
the derived verb ‘claims’ that he himself is the object of the embedded verb; the subject of the embedded verb is
indefinite (‘someone’, ‘something’), understood from the context, or expressed by a noun in the terminalis case:
tangvag- ‘to watch’

tangvagniuq ‘he says that someone is watching him’ (the
speaker); tangvagniuq arnamun ‘he says that the woman is
watching him’ (the speaker)

alike- ‘to fear’

alikniuq ‘he says that someone fears him’ (the speaker); alikniuq
arnamun ‘he says that the woman fears him’ (the speaker)

4) Embedded verb considered transitive; derived verb used with a transitive ending. In this case the subject of
the derived verb ‘claims’ that the object of the derived verb is the object of the embedded verb. The subject of the
embedded verb is indefinite, understood from context, or expressed by a noun in the terminalis case (and it may
or may not be the same as the subject of the derived verb):
tangvag- ‘to watch’

tangvagnia ‘he says that someone is watching him’ (another);
tangvagnia arnamun ‘he says that the woman is watching
him’ (another); tangvagnia ellminun ‘he says that he himself
is watching him’ (another)

alike- ‘to fear’

aliknia ‘he says that someone fears him’ (another); aliknia
arnamun ‘he says that the woman fears him’ (another)
In all cases the absolutive case term (subject or object) of the embedded verb is identical with the absolutive case
term of the derived verb.
Angun neryugniuq. ‘The man says that he wants to eat.’ (polarity combination 1)
Angutem arnaq neryugnia. ‘The man says that the woman wants to eat.’ (polarity combination 2)
Angun neryugniuq carayagmun. ‘The man says that the bear wants to eat him.’ (polarity
combination 3)
Angutem arnaq neryugnia carayagmun. ‘The man says that the bear wants to eat the woman.’

with consonant-final bases, and tv, whether from this (t) or base final te, becomes p.

Central Yup’ik, excluding HBC, this postbase is realized as –’¥rluq (where the apostrophe indicates extra
stress); however, when this postbase is added to a base whose final vowel is prime and in position for rhythmic
lengthening, the resulting configuration, VCV’¥rluq, becomes VCV’urluq (where the apostrophe indicates that
the consonant is not geminated). Furthermore, when added to a base ending in g, the postbase is realized as

-r(ur)luq*

is in position for rhythmic lengthening or is preceded by another vowel. Otherwise, it is realized as ~–u’rluq

in g, the postbase is realized as +urluq in HBC as elsewhere. Note that the dialect variation in “(ur)-deletion”

+te-2 to act on one so as to cause it to V # non-productive; many verb bases cannot be used with a transitive
ending unless this postbase is inserted immediately after the verb base; with other verb bases, however, the
transitive ending without this postbase incorporates the meaning of this postbase (and consequently this postbase
is not used with those bases). Thus, it is an apparently unpredictable characteristic of each verb whether or not
this postbase is needed to form a transitive; for example, qip’uq means it twisted and nip’uq means it went
out; but to say he twisted it one says qipaa (without using this postbase), whereas to say he put it out one says
niptaa (with this postbase); takes transitive endings (except for reflexive or passive intransitives); follows the
