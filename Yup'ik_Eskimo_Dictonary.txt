INTRODUCTION TO THE POSTBASES
General Remarks
A Yup’ik postbase is a derivational suffix similar to English suffixes such as ‘-ment’ in ‘argument’,
but different from a Yup’ik ending, which is an inflectional suffix, such as the English plural ending ‘s’ in
‘arguments’. However, postbases play a much larger role in Yup’ik than do the derivational suffixes in
English. A Yup’ik word may have zero, one, or more postbases, sometimes as many as half a dozen, but
infrequently more than that.
A postbase modifies the part of the word that comes before it. Consequently, the order of
postbases in a Yup’ik word generally parallels (though in reverse order) the corresponding parts
of the English phrase or sentence that translates the Yup’ik word. For example, the Yup’ik word
angyarpaliciqngatuq consists of the morphemes angyar-, -pa-, -li-, -cig, -ngat-, and -uq, which
translate respectively as ‘boat’, ‘big’, ‘make’, ‘will probably’, ‘he’, so the entire word translates as
‘he probably will make a big boat’. In cases where postbase ordering does not correspond with English
translation, this fact has been noted for the entries for the postbases involved.
In the following pages (and in the English-Yup’ik index), a hyphen at the beginning of a postbase serves
to distinguish postbases from bases. In the postbase section itself, various suffixation symbols, rather than
the hyphen, indicate how the postbase goes onto various base configurations.

Order and Format of Postbase Citations; Cross-References
Postbases are listed alphabetically. Some postbases are cited with their first letters in parentheses. This
indicates that the first letter is not used with all types of bases, and this letter in parentheses is not considered
in alphabetizing the primary entry of the postbase in question. There are entries based alphabetically
on letters in parentheses, but these are cross-references referring the reader to the main entry, and these
cross references are enclosed in braces, { }. Thus, the postbase -(s)ta ‘one who Vs’ (where ‘V’ stands for
‘verb’) has its initial s in parentheses because this s does not appear with all types of bases; this postbase
is alphabetized as if it were merely -ta, but there is also a cross-reference at -sta directing the reader to -ta.
Some postbases are cited with several forms (allomorphs), the choice of which one to use being determined
by the type of base to which the postbase is affixed. Such allomorphs are listed together and separated by
a slash, /. The second allomorph is also listed separately as a cross-reference in braces, directing the reader
to the primary entry, if that second allomorph differs alphabetically from the first to a notable degree. Thus,
the postbase -pakar- / -vakar- ‘to V for so long’, has its primary entry under the letter p, but there is also

729

Postbases
a cross-reference under -vakar- directing the reader to -pakar-. Some postbases begin with a consonant
cluster, the first member of which is a velar. Because a reader encountering such a postbase on a base
might consider the velar not to be part of the postbase but to be from the base instead, such a postbase also
has a cross-reference in braces, without the initial velar. For example, the postbase -ksaite- ‘to have not
V-ed’, has a cross-reference under -saite-. Some postbases begin with a front velar that is realized as a back
velar when used with certain bases (and conversely, some postbases begin with a back velar that may be
realized as a front velar). Such a postbase has a cross-reference in braces under the corresponding back (or
front) velar, directing the reader to the form with the front (or back) velar. For example, the postbase -rraq
‘small N’ (where ‘N’ stands for ‘noun’) may be realized as -ggaq, and therefore it has a cross-reference for
this secondary form. Most postbases that begin with a y may be realized as beginning with c or s rather
than with y when used with certain bases. These postbases have cross-references in braces for their forms
beginning with c and s. For example, the postbase -yug- ‘to want to V’ has cross-references under -cug- and
-sug-, directing the reader to the primary entry -yug. The reason for the multiplicity of cross-references is to
make this postbase list as useful as possible for one seeking a particular postbase that he has encountered
in a Yup’ik word, a task that may be difficult because of the complex nature of Yup’ik juncture phonology.
Citation forms for postbases follow the same pattern as those of nouns and verb bases. Thus, postbases
that yield nouns are cited in their unpossessed absolutive singular forms, and postbases that yield verbs
are cited in their base or combining forms followed by a hyphen and translated with an English infinitive.
For example, the postbase -(s)ta ‘one who V-s’, yields nouns whose unpossessed absolutive singular forms
end in a, although the combining form of this postbase is -(s)te-. On the other hand, the postbase -nge- ‘to
acquire N’, yields verbs whose combining forms end, as the citation form does, in e.
If two or more postbases have the same form, discounting suffixation symbols (discussed below) and
initial letters in parentheses, then these postbases are numbered with superscripts, and these superscripted
numbers are used in the English-to-Yup’ik index. Examples are the postbase -kar(aq*)1 ‘small N’, and the
postbase -(s)kar(aq*)2 ‘one who Vs’, and these two postbases are referred to in the English-to-Yup’ik index
(where initial letters are not used) as -kar(aq*)1 and -kar(aq*)2.

Suffixation Symbols at Postbase Entries and Their Meanings
Each postbase is preceded by a symbol or several symbols such as +, ~, –, :, @, etc., that indicate how the
postbase affixes to bases. Note that the following also applies to endings (inflectional suffixes), which are
introduced by the same symbols. A description of the meaning of these symbols is given in the following list.
A detailed exposition is given in Practical Grammar of . . . Yup’ik (Jacobson 1995), where the symbols are used
in the same way as in this dictionary. Furthermore, in this dictionary the hyphen is used only as a general
sign at the beginning of a suffix (as it has been used in this introductory section) and to introduce postbases
only in cross-references and in the English-to-Yup’ik index, whereas hyphen serves as a minus sign (–).
The suffixation symbols are as follows:
+ indicates that the suffix keeps final consonants of bases (and if the base does not end in a consonant, the
postbase merely affixes to the base without changing it).
– indicates that the suffix drops final consonants from bases.
~ indicates that the suffix drops final e from bases.
% indicates that the suffix keeps “strong” final consonants (every g, and any r that is preceded by e or that
ends a base of the form CVVr- or that is marked with an asterisk), drops “weak” final consonants.

730

Postbases
: indicates that the suffix drops voiced velar continuants (fricatives and nasals, g, r, or ng) if they occur
between single vowels of which at least the first is full.
’ indicates that the suffix causes gemination of the final consonant of a base of the form (C)VCe-.
. indicates that the suffix is affixed with no change to either base or suffix at the juncture.
@ indicates that with te ending bases, after the final e has been dropped (all @ type postbases are also ~
type), the suffix affects the t of the base in some way, depending on whether the te is preceded by a
consonant or vowel, and if preceded by a vowel, whether the te is “special”,1 and also on how the
postbase itself begins.
If a @ type suffix begins with n, then base final t drops only when preceded by a fricative, which is then
devoiced (as is the n, automatically), or by a nasal or stop and then the n is devoiced. Thus, affixing the
postbase @~+ni- ‘to say that one is V-ing’ to kipute- ‘to purchase’, ce÷irte- ‘to visit’, nangte- ‘to torment’,
and apte- ‘to ask’ yields kiputnia ‘he says that she is purchasing’, ce÷irrnia ‘he says that she is visiting’,
nangn´gnia ‘he says that she is being tormented’, and apnia ‘he says that she asked’.2
If a @ type postbase begins with ng, m, or v, then base final t preceded vowel and is the t of a nonspecial
te changes to s (y in HBC and EG), but if it is of a “special” te, it changes to l. If preceded by a fricative,
the t is dropped and the fricative is devoiced (as is the ng, m, or v), if by a nasal or stop the t is dropped
and the ng, m, or v devoiced. Thus affixing the postbase @~+ngaite- ‘ to not be going to V’ to kipute- ‘to
purchase’, maan(e)te- ‘to be here’ (special te), ce÷irte- ‘to visit’, and nangte- ‘to torment’, gives kipusngaituq
(kipuyngaituq for HBC and EG) ‘he won’t purchase’, maanelngaituq ‘he won’t be here’, ce÷irrngaituq ‘he
won’t visit’, nangn´gaitaa ‘he won’t torment him’, and apngaituq ‘he won’t ask’.3
If a @ type postbase begins with y, then a resulting ty (hence ts) becomes c. Affixing the postbase @~+yug- ‘to
want to V’ to kipute- ‘to buy’ gives *kiputyugaa (hence *kiputsugaa) hence kipucugaa ‘he wants to buy it’.
If a @ type postbase begins with (u) and if base final t is preceded by a vowel of a nonspecial te, then that t changes
to y (to s if geminated on “short” base except in HBC and EG), but if is of a “special” te, to l. If preceded by a fricative,
the t is dropped and the fricative remains voiced. If the t is preceded by a nasal or stop, it is treated as though it had e
preceding it. Thus, affixing the postbase @~:(u)ciq ‘whether/how one is V’ to kipute- ‘to purchase’, kit’e- ‘to sink’,
maan(e)te- ‘to be here’, ce÷irte- ‘to visit’, nangte- ‘to abuse’, and apte- ‘to ask’ gives kipuyucianek ‘whether he
is purchasing’, kis’ucianek (kiy’ucianeng for HBC), maanelucianek, or more commonly, maanlucianek ‘whether
he is here’, ce÷irucianek ‘whether he is visiting’, nangyucianek ‘whether he is being tormented’, and apyucianek
‘whether he is asking’.
If a @ type postbase begins with y, then any base final t combines with the y to yield c. Thus, affixing
the postbase @~+yug- ‘to want to V’, to kipute-, kit’e-, maan(e)te-, ce÷irte-, nangte-, and apte-, yields
kipucugtuq ‘he want to purchase’, kic’ugtuq, maancugtuq, ce÷ircugtuq, nangcugtuq, and apcugtuq.
Some patterns with @ apply only to endings (derivational suffixes).

See General Introduction concerning “special” te.

lternatively the last bases can be treated as being nangete- and apete-, yieldng nangetnia and apetnia, and similarly for
others like them.

3

Alternatively the last bases can be treated as being nangete- and apete-, yielding nangesngaitaa and apesngaitaa, and
similarly for other like them.

731

Postbases
If a @ type ending begins with l, then any base-final t combines with l to yield ll. Thus, affixing
the ending @~+luk ‘let’s2 V’ to the above set of sample bases yields kipulluk ‘let’s2 purchase’; kill’uk;
maanlluk; *ce÷irlluk, which, in accordance with the orthographical rules, is respelled ce÷irrluk; nanglluk;
and *aplluk, which is respelled apluk.
If a @ type ending begins with g, k, or ng, then any base-final t except one that is “special” changes
to s (to y in HBC and EG), inserting e before the s to prevent a three-consonant cluster if necessary. Thus,
affixing the ending @~+ki ‘(you1) V them’ to kipute-, ce÷irte-, nangte-, and apte- yields kipuski ‘buy
them’, ce÷ireski ‘visit them’, nangeski ‘torment them’, and apeski ‘ask them’. When affixing such endings
where there is a base-final “special” t, that t changes to l. Thus, with nerenrite- ‘to not eat’, where te is
special being from a negative postbase, the result is nerenrilki ‘don’t eat them’.
Postbases and endings marked with @ that affect t in ways other than those listed above are described
at the entry for each such postbase.
A long dash, ––, indicates that the base drops both the final consonant and the vowel preceding it. This
applies only to shortened forms of consonant-dropping postbases beginning with li. For example, –i- ‘to
make’ and angyaq ‘boat’ yields angyi- ‘to make a boat’.
An initial question mark, ?, indicates that the postbase affixes in an irregular way. This applies only to
certain nonproductive postbases.
Some suffixes have initial q, k, r, g, rr, or gg. With these and with a base ending in the opposite type
of velar (i.e., back as opposed to front, and conversely) the opposite type of velar to that underlined is
used. Thus, given the postbase -qatar- ‘to be about to V’, when added to bases ending in a vowel or r, this
postbase takes the form -qatar-, but when added to bases ending in g, it takes the form -katar-. Thus, from
cali- ‘to work’, qavar- ‘to sleep’, and ayag- ‘to go’ arise caliqatartuq ‘he is about to work’, qavaqatartuq ‘he
is about to sleep’, but ayakatartuq ‘he is about to go’. In the rare case in which a suffix has such an initial
letter but does not change in this way, this fact is noted in words.
Another process that applies in almost all cases where certain conditions hold and therefore is not
specifically noted as such (but is noted in words when it does not happen) is the dropping of a “semifinal” e (e followed by base-final g or r) by a suffix that begins with a vowel in the form which it is used on
the base with the semi-final e. For example, when the ending %:(ng)it ‘their Ns’ is used with consonantending bases, it takes the form it. When used with bases of words such as yaqulek ‘bird’ and egaleq
‘window’, which have semi-final e, that e is dropped, yielding yaqulgit ‘their birds’ and egalrit ‘their
windows’.
The letters in parentheses at the beginnings of postbases are generally used as follows:
(g) is used with bases ending in two vowels.
(i) is used with bases ending in te.
(ng) is used with bases ending in a vowel.
(r) is used with bases ending in te, and by some speakers in e not preceded by t.
(s) is used with bases ending in a vowel.
(t) is used with bases ending in a consonant.
(u) is used with bases ending in a consonant or e.

732

Postbases
The use of letters in parentheses in ways not conforming to these patterns is described under the
relevant postbase entries.
Such symbols as * following a postbase, and (ar) at the end of a postbase or followed by te at the
end of a postbase, are explained in the General Introduction, as is the convention for treating an entry
that is both nominal and verbal. In addition, the General Introduction addresses the use of the dialect
abbreviations NSU, NSK, NS, Y, HBC, NUN, NI, CAN, K, BB, NR, UK, EG, and LI.

Concerning the Types of Words with Which Particular Postbases Are Used and the Types
They Yield
A postbase generally falls into one of four categories. There are postbases that affix to nouns and yield
nouns, postbases that affix to verbs and yield verbs, postbases that convert nouns to verbs, and postbases
that convert verbs to nouns. Beyond these categories are a handful of postbases that yield uninflectable
words, that is, particles. In the postbase listings, ‘N’ stands for ‘noun’ (including demonstrative pronouns,
demonstrative adverbs, and nominal roots4), and ‘V’ stands for ‘verb’ (including verbal roots5). Thus one
can tell whether a given postbase affixes to nouns, verbs, or both by noting whether ‘N’ or ‘V’ is used in
the translation, and one can tell whether the postbase yields verbs or nouns by the way the postbase is
cited (i.e., whether it ends in a hyphen), and by whether the translation is given as an English infinitive. If
a postbase is further restricted to use only with bases of a certain semantic type, such as body part nouns,
game animal nouns, and adjectival verbs, this is indicated in the discussion at the entry for the postbase.
After a postbase is given, a brief translation is given. These translations have been formulated to
summarize the meaning of the postbase as succinctly as possible (unlike verb bases, verb-yielding postbases
are translated in a way that reflects their transitive and intransitive uses whenever feasible); but in the case
of postbases, even more than in the case of noun and verb bases, the meaning will often become far clearer
from the examples. Consequently, a number of examples are provided for each postbase, both to illustrate
its meaning and use and to show how it affixes to various bases. But, before the examples are given, there
are often explanatory notes.

Polarity of Postbases and the Question of Productivity; Criteria for Inclusion Here
In the entries’ explanatory notes, there is information about the polarity (see the General Introduction
for the meaning of this term) of a verb-yielding postbase. Unless otherwise noted, a verb-to-verb postbase
preserves the polarity of the verb base to which it is affixed. Thus the postbase -yug- ‘to want to V’ changes
ner’uq ‘he is eating’ and neraa ‘he is eating it’ to neryugtuq ‘he wants to eat’ and neryugaa ‘he wants to eat
it’, with the polarity unchanged. In the case of some verb-to-verb postbases and all noun-to-verb postbases,
it is necessary to indicate the polarity of the resulting verbs by statement or discussion often involving the
use of the symbol / on examples formed with the postbase in question (see the General Introduction for the
use of the symbol /). In the case of noun-yielding postbases (noun-to-noun and verb-to-noun), the resulting
nouns generally take both unpossessed and possessed endings with the usual meaning of ‘possession’, but
in the few cases where only one type of ending (possessed or unpossessed) may be used with the resulting
noun, or where the possessed form of the resulting noun has an unusual meaning, this is described fully. In
discussions of polarity and possession, the term embedded denotes the noun or verb to which the postbase in
question is affixed, while the term derived denotes the noun or verb formed upon affixation of the postbase
in question.

Nominal roots are primarily the dimensional roots such as ‘thickness’, ‘height’, discussed in the General Introduction.

Verbal roots are primarily the emotional roots such as ‘respecting’, ‘being repulsed’, and the postural roots such as ‘lying
down’, ‘turning over’.

733

Postbases
Unless otherwise noted, postbases are “productive” in that they can be used freely with any base
subject to semantic and/or distributional limitations as indicated. However, some postbases are noted
as being “nonproductive”, which means that they cannot be used freely in modern Yup’ik speech. Such
postbases are recognizable in a number of words and may or may not have a discernible meaning. For
example, -quq appears in more than 35 words, mostly body-part terms, but it cannot be used to form new
words in the way that a productive postbase can be used. In some cases one can recognize the base to
which -quq has been added, while in other cases one cannot, but the meaning of this postbase cannot be
determined. Nonproductive postbases with as few as two occurrences have also been identified and listed
in this section if their meanings are determinable. For example, -ngar- has been found on only three verb
bases, but from these three the meaning of the postbase, ‘to have the bad habit of V-ing’, is quite apparent.
However, this postbase is not productive, since it cannot be used to speak of bad habits other than those
expressed in these three certain verb bases. The attempt has been made to give a full listing of a occurrences
of each nonproductive postbase. Undoubtedly some nonproductive postbases have more occurrences
than are listed, and some postbases that are claimed to be nonproductive are probably at least marginally
productive in some Yup’ik-speaking areas, and there may be (nonproductive) postbases occurring on two
or more words that have not been identified.
Nonproductive postbases that occur on only one word, or on several words but without a common
determinable meaning, are not listed in the postbase section, but they will be found incorporated in the
words in which they occur where these words are listed in the main section of the dictionary. Thus, while
kitngu- ‘to capsize’ is certainly derived from kit’e- ‘to sink’, the postbase -ngu- is not known to occur
elsewhere in the language. For this reason, -ngu- is not found in the postbase section (even though a
meaning might well be ascribed to it on the basis of its one occurrence).

Format of Examples; Lexicalization
Examples are generally given first in a two-column format. The left column has a noun or verb base,
and the right column has the combination of that noun or verb with the postbase in question, and in the
case of verb-yielding postbases, a simple ending.6 Thus, for the postbase +(s)ciigate- ‘to be unable to V’,
an example might have on the left qavar- ‘to sleep’ and on the right qavarciigatuq ‘he is unable to sleep’.
The comment “(lexicalized)” after a base plus postbase example and translation means that this
combination has a meaning not entirely predictable from the meaning of its component parts. The predictable
meaning may be a possibility to some speakers in some contexts, or it may be completely overshadowed
by the lexicalized meaning. Thus, tengssuun is literally ‘a device for flying’ but is lexicalized as ‘airplane’.
A device for flying that is not an airplane would not normally be referred to as tengssuun, but the word
tengssuun might be used in reference to it in a sentence such as tengssuutnguuq ‘it is a device for flying’.
On the other hand, angyayagaq literally means ‘baby boat’ or ‘little boat’ but has the lexicalized meaning
‘shrew’, and no one aware of this meaning would ever use the word angyayagaq with its literal meaning.
At the bottom of the list of single-word examples, there may be one or more examples introduced by the
phrase “Also, irregularly:”. These are cases in which the postbase in question has been affixed in an irregular
(and therefore nonproductive) way, quite often with a meaning other than what one would predict. Thus,
in addition to the regular productive combination of neqa ‘fish, food’ and -liur- ‘to work on N’, yielding
neq’liurtuq ‘he is working on fish or food’, there is also the irregular combination neqliurtuq ‘he is serving
food’.
The final items of an entry may consist of examples in sentence contexts. In some cases, these examples
6

This two column format for postbase examples will be very familiar to anyone who has used the 1984 edition of this
dictionary, of Practical Grammar of … Yup’ik (Jacobson 1995), or Yup’ik Eskimo Grammar (Reed et al. 1977).

734

Postbases
serve merely to enliven the presentation, but in other cases these examples illustrate the use of the postbase
in ways that a single-word example cannot, and/or they show how associated nouns and verbs are used
together with the postbase in question. Thus, a sentence example with the postbase that forms comparatives
illustrates what case ending is used on the noun denoting the object with which the comparison is
being made. While some sentences examples were composed specifically for this dictionary, others are
from published texts as in the bases section of the dictionary. However, the postbase in question in these
multiword sentence examples are in boldface here in the postbases section.7 The part of the translation
that corresponds to the postbase in question is in italics. Sometimes a segment of the translation has been
retranslated literally (if somewhat clumsily) as well and set off by a dash or dashes. Thus:

Etymology of Postbases
The proto-Eskimo or proto-Yup’ik form (indicated by “< PE pb. –”, or “< PY pb. –”), if there is one, or the
derivation of the postbase (indicated by “< –”), if the postbase is composed of two or more other postbases.
(A composite postbase is listed because it departs from the predictable combination of those postbases in
form, meaning, or use, or if it is otherwise noteworthy — as with the composite bases). In the case of a
postbase that occurs in compounds with other postbases, there is a list of such occurrences (indicated by
“> –”).

Postbases of Endearment or Denigration
These postbases — -lkuk/-lkug- ‘darned one, irritating’, -(ur)luq/-(ur)lur- ‘dear old’, and -ya(g)aq/
-ya(g)ar- ‘dear little’, (and others) — pertain to the nominal entities if they are used on nouns, and to the
verbal concepts if used on verbs when there are separate nouns for the subject and object. However, if
no such separate noun is present, then the postbase can apply to the subject of the intransitive verb or
sometimes the object (or possibly the subject) of the transitive verb. For example: with angun ‘man’ and
ce÷irte- ‘to visit’, one gets angutelkuk ce÷irtuq ‘the darned man is visiting’ and ce÷irtelkugtuq ‘he is
visiting in an irritating way’. The later also means ‘he, the darned one, is visiting’. Similarly, we have
angutelkuk ce÷irtaa ‘he is visiting the darned man’ and ce÷irtelkugaa ‘he is visiting him in an irritating
way’, or sometimes ‘he is visiting him, the darned one’ (or possibly ‘he, darned him, is visiting him’).

Irregular Possession with Certain Postbases
Certain nominalizing postbases used with possessive endings result in forms where the possessor is
not exactly the possessor (in the regular sense of possession) of the derived noun, but rather corresponds
to the subject of the embedded verb. Thus, postbase -lleq ‘one that V-ed or was V-ed’ and base ce÷irte- ‘to
visit’ yield unpossessed ce÷irtelleq ‘the one who visited’, but possessed arnam ce÷irtellra, not meaning
‘the woman’s one who visited’, yields instead ‘the one who the woman visited’.
Norminalizing postbases used on patientive or transitive-only bases and with possessed endings result
7

Be aware that the boundaries of a postbase within a word are only often not exactly determinable. For example, the
postbase -qapigte- ‘to be very V’, occurs in kaikapigcugnarquq ‘he is probably very hungry’, between the base kaig- ‘to be
hungry’ and the postbase -yugnarqe- ‘to probably V’, but it is largely a matter of convention or formulation that this books
says that the presence of the postbase in the word in question begins at k and ends with g, thus in an example quoted from
a text, it is written kaikapigcugnarquq. To be precise one would have to say that it begins partway through k (since the final
g of the base changes the q the postbase to k), and ends partway through c (since the final te of the postbase combines with
the y of the next postbase to yield c). Also, in some case the presence of a given postbase is revealed only in the adjoining
morphemes, so in tuntuvagcugtuq ‘he wants to catch a moose’, from tuntuvak ‘moose’, -te- ‘to catch N’, and -yug- ‘to want
to V’, only the fact that y is changed to c reveals that the presence of the postbase, so the word is written with no boldface but
with the parenthesized note: (tuntuvagte-yugtuq).

735

Postbases
in forms where the possessor corresponds to the object of the embedded verb. Thus, postbases -sta ‘V-er’
and -lleq ‘act of V-ing or being V-ed’ and base kitugte- ‘to fix’ yield possessed uum kitugtestii and uum
kitugtellra, meaning ‘the one who fixed this one’ and ‘the fixing of this one’.
Certain noun-elaborating postbases used with possessed endings result in forms where the possessor
is not exactly the possessor (in the regular sense of possession) of the derived noun. Thus postbase -liaq
‘made N’ and noun atkuk ‘parka’ yield arnam atkuliara, not meaning ‘the woman’s made parka’ but
rather ‘the parka the woman made’ (whether it is hers or not).

Gemination and/or Syncope within the Base with Postbases Expressing Suddenness
With postbases expressing ‘suddenly’, ‘abruptly’, ‘merely (and without further ado)’, and so forth,
there can be gemination and/or syncope back within the base for emphasis. For example, with qilug- ‘to
bark (at)’ and -ngar(ar)te- ‘to suddenly begin to V’, one can say qilungartaa for ‘it suddenly began to bark
at him’ or, for emphasis, qil’ungartaa. Again, with mayur- ‘to go up’ and -qerte- ‘to suddenly V’, one can
get mayuqertuq ‘he suddenly went up’, or for emphasis, may’uqertuq, and for yet more emphasis,
masqertuq.

The following postbases, -li-, -liaq, –linqigte-, -linraq*, -liqe-1, -liqe-2, -lir-, -liur-, -liyar-, start with li and
drop the final consonant of the base to which they are attached. With such postbases it is generally permissible to
delete the l of the postbase and the preceding vowel after the postbase has been attached. For example, angyaliuq ‘he
is making a boat’ can be shortened to angyiuq. In some cases, however, the shortened form is not acceptable to all
speakers. In other cases the shortened form is preferred to the longer form, and in some cases the shortened form has
acquired a meaning slightly different from that of the longer form. This is particularly true of -li- and -lir-; for this
reason, the shortened forms -i- and -ir- are listed as postbases in their own right.

@~+ni- to say or claim that oneself or another is V-ing # this is a “compound verbal postbase,” as are -cete-1,
-cetaar-, -sqe-, -vkar-, -ciite-, -staili-, -nayuke-, -yuke-, and -rqe-2; the remarks on polarity concerning this
base consequently apply to the other compound verbal postbases as well; see also Practical Grammar of . . .
Yup’ik (p. 322ff); < -niThere are four possible polarity combinations:
1) Embedded verb considered intransitive; derived verb used with an intransitive ending; in this case the subject of
the derived verb ‘claims’ (‘causes’, ‘wants’, or ‘believes’, etc., with the other compound verbal postbases) that he
himself is the subject of the embedded verb:
tangvag- ‘to watch’

tangvagniuq ‘he says that he (himself) is watching’

pinir- ‘to be strong’

pinirniuq ‘he says that he (himself) is strong’

2) Embedded verb considered intransitive; derived verb used with a transitive ending; in this case, the subject of
the derived verb ‘claims’ that the object of the derived verb is the subject of the embedded verb:
tangvag- ‘to watch’

tangvagnia ‘he says that he (another) is watching’

pinir- ‘to be strong’

pinirnia ‘he says that he (another) is strong’

3) Embedded verb considered transitive; derived verb used with an intransitive ending; in this case the subject of
the derived verb ‘claims’ that he himself is the object of the embedded verb; the subject of the embedded verb is
indefinite (‘someone’, ‘something’), understood from the context, or expressed by a noun in the terminalis case:
tangvag- ‘to watch’

tangvagniuq ‘he says that someone is watching him’ (the
speaker); tangvagniuq arnamun ‘he says that the woman is
watching him’ (the speaker)

alike- ‘to fear’

alikniuq ‘he says that someone fears him’ (the speaker); alikniuq
arnamun ‘he says that the woman fears him’ (the speaker)

4) Embedded verb considered transitive; derived verb used with a transitive ending. In this case the subject of
the derived verb ‘claims’ that the object of the derived verb is the object of the embedded verb. The subject of the
embedded verb is indefinite, understood from context, or expressed by a noun in the terminalis case (and it may
or may not be the same as the subject of the derived verb):
tangvag- ‘to watch’

tangvagnia ‘he says that someone is watching him’ (another);
tangvagnia arnamun ‘he says that the woman is watching
him’ (another); tangvagnia ellminun ‘he says that he himself
is watching him’ (another)

alike- ‘to fear’

aliknia ‘he says that someone fears him’ (another); aliknia
arnamun ‘he says that the woman fears him’ (another)
In all cases the absolutive case term (subject or object) of the embedded verb is identical with the absolutive case
term of the derived verb.
Angun neryugniuq. ‘The man says that he wants to eat.’ (polarity combination 1)
Angutem arnaq neryugnia. ‘The man says that the woman wants to eat.’ (polarity combination 2)
Angun neryugniuq carayagmun. ‘The man says that the bear wants to eat him.’ (polarity
combination 3)
Angutem arnaq neryugnia carayagmun. ‘The man says that the bear wants to eat the woman.’

–qaqe-1 to V now and then; to V intermittently # used with the subordinative mood; when this postbase -qaqefollows an unstressed syllable, it takes the form -qa’aqe-; note that this postbase is underlyingly -qaraqe- (from
-qar- and +’(g)aqe-) with -qaqe- and -qa’aqe- arising by deletion of a between r and q, and deletion of r
before qe with a subsequent e-dropping suffix; thus nerqaqluni comes from nerqaraqluni (still possible but
uncommon) via underlying *nerqarqluni, and quuyurniqa’aqluni comes from quuyurniqaraqluni (still

+te-2 to act on one so as to cause it to V # non-productive; many verb bases cannot be used with a transitive
ending unless this postbase is inserted immediately after the verb base; with other verb bases, however, the
transitive ending without this postbase incorporates the meaning of this postbase (and consequently this postbase
is not used with those bases). Thus, it is an apparently unpredictable characteristic of each verb whether or not
this postbase is needed to form a transitive; for example, qip’uq means it twisted and nip’uq means it went
out; but to say he twisted it one says qipaa (without using this postbase), whereas to say he put it out one says
niptaa (with this postbase); takes transitive endings (except for reflexive or passive intransitives); follows the

1. The a of the third person subject transitive indicative marker is deleted with those bases and those endings where the a
would lead to a three-vowel cluster. Technically it would be more accurate to say that this marker is +’(g)ar-, and to change
the subject-object markers accordingly, so that, for example, the 3s-3s marker would be :a, the 1s-3s marker would be -ka,
the 1s-2s marker would be -mken, and the 2s-1s marker would be +penga.
2. Also rput, rpuk, rci, and rtek.
3. Also agnenga and rpetegnenga.
4. Also vnga, vkut, vkuk, vcia, etc.

1. When these endings are used on a base ending in te, the resulting tl becomes ll.
2. Also %(e)lta.
3. Drops te from bases.
4. With bases ending in a single prime vowel, this ending is Ø; with bases ending in two vowels or e, this ending is (g)i;
with bases ending in te, this ending is n; but with bases ending in special te, it is lu (except in HBC, where it is n); and with
bases ending in a consonant, this ending is :a.
5. The 3d-3s ending may also be n’gu, and the others in this row may insert ne after g.
6. Changes te to s but special te to l.
7. With bases ending in a single prime vowel, this ending is u; with bases ending in two vowels or e, this ending is (g)iu;
with bases ending in te, this is @gu, chaning te to s but special te to l; and with bases ending in a consonant, this ending is
-guu.
8. May be ken instead of mken.
9. When these endings are used with a base ending in two vowels or e, (g)i may be used before the ending, in which case
velar dropping occurs with the 2s-1s ending, causing it to be, in effect, a rather than nga.

1. When these endings are used on a base ending in te, the resulting tl becomes ll; however, when these endings are used on a base ending in special
te- or after the postbase vke-/+peke-, which replaces -nrite- ‘no not V,’ the marker of this mood is @na-, dropping the t and sometimes changing
preceding i to u, rather than @~+lu-, and the 2s subject intransitive and 2s object transitive ending is k rather than ten. Furthermore, the 1s object
transitive ending and the 1s subject intransitive ending, which are shown on the chart as a (actually :nga), will combine with @na- to give @nii
(from @nanga).
2. nung in HBC.

1. With bases ending in a stop consonant or voiceless fricative followed by e, er, or eg, the marker will be -llria- for many
speakers. With bases ending in special te-, themarker is @+ngur*- for 3rd person subject, @+ngu- for other subjects (rather
than -lria-), changing te to l. With this marker, the 1s ending is a (from :nga).
2. With these endings, the intransitive participal marker is -lrii- rather than -lria-.
3. Base final te changes to s, but special te changes to l; e from this marker is deleted when the person/number marker
begins with a vowel.

1. The final consonant of consonant-ending connective mood markers is subject to velar-dropping while the final vowel of
vowel-ending markers is deleted with these third person subject endings.
2. The intransitive endings for the First and Second Contemporative moods are like the localis case endings; that is, they
are :ani, :atni, -mni, mte÷i, megni, +peni, +pece÷i, +petegni, +mini, +meggni, +megni.
3. The 1s intransitive ending is +ma, but all the other first person subject endings are the consonant-dropping type.
4. The forms .vet, .vgu, .vciu, etc. are used with vowel-ending connective mood markers, while consant-ending markers
take the corresponding forms +pet, +pegu, +peciu, etc.
5. All fourth person subject endings begin with n rather than m for the Conditional mood; that is, they are ni, niu, neng,
etc. rather than mi, miu, meng, etc.
6. With the First and Second Contemporative moods, ni is inserted between the subject and object components of 4s subject
transitive endings, giving miniu, miniki, etc. rather than miu, miki, etc. Some dialects use this ni in other transitive endings as well.

The markers of the Connective moods are @~+(t)vaileg- for the Precessive, @~:(ng)a- for the Consequential, +’(g)aqa- for
the Contingent, @+ngr(ar)- for the Concessive, @~-ku- for the Conditional, -ller- for the First Contemporative, and @:(ng)
inaner- for the Second Contemporative.

ENCLITICS
Enclitics are additional suffixes that follow the
inflectional ending of a word. There may be zero,
one, two, or (rarely) three or more enclitics on a
word. Enclitics are normally written separated
from the rest of the word and from each other by
hyphens (except as noted below) , but they are
cited in this dictionary’s listings and in derivations
with the equals sign, “=”. With the exception of
the enclitic =llu ‘and’ and =i, which functions as
a “verbal pointer”, an enclitic affects the meaning
of the entire sentence (or clause) in which it occurs,
and not just that of the single word to which it is
attached. If a sentence has an enclitic (other than
the two mentioned above), then that enclitic
usually occurs on the first word of the sentence
(or clause). Most enclitics do not translate well
with a single English word or phrase; rather, their
meaning derives from the contexts and grammatical
constructions in which they are used. Consequently
English translations are omitted from the following
discussion of enclitic morphophonemics.
The morphophonemics of enclitic attachment
differs in certain ways from that of postbase or
ending attachment.
A stop consonant preceding one of the enclitics
=am, =kiq, =mi, and =tuq may optionally be
replaced by a fricative, t being replaced by s, q by
r, and k by g. If this occurs, the hyphen is omitted
in writing. For example, an’uq-am may become
an’uram, ukuk-mi may become ukugmi, and tailittuq may become tailistuq. Such a process does not
occur with other enclitics.
The enclitics =qaa, =kin, and =wa (or =gga)
begin with geminated consonants if they are used
with words that end in vowels. Thus nuna-qaa
and piksailama-wa are pronounced as if they
were written nunaq’aa and piksailamaw’a. Other
enclitics do not entail such gemination. The enclitic

933

=qaa, when used with a word ending in q, results
in a cluster of a released q from the base of the word
followed by a second q from the enclitic, angyaq’qaa
(though for some people the q in question ends one
syllable and begins the next without being released
in between, angyaqaa). Analogous situations with
=tuq and words ending in t, or with =kin and word
ending in k, are avoided by the process discussed
above.
If an open syllable precedes the sole or final
enclitic of a word, and if that open syllable is due
to receive stress, “stress retraction” (see general
introduction) does not occur, and the vowel of that
open syllable is lengthened (note that, in a sense,
=qaa, =kin, and =wa never follow an open syllable
because they close the preceding syllable, as
discussed above). Thus, for example, kuigpagmillu is pronounced with mi long; that is, stress is not
retracted from the syllable mi; however, it differs
from *kuigpagmiillu in that in kuigpagmi-llu the
syllable -pag- does not get secondary stress.
The boundary between a word that ends with
a vowel and an enclitic that begins with a vowel
(=i or =am) acts like a consonant. Thus pika-i is
pronounced as if it were written pika’i (where k is
not geminated, and a is rhythmically lengthened).
The rather complex and varied morphophonemics of enclitic attachment, including other particulars concerning syllable boundaries within a word
vs. word/enclitic boundaries vs. word boundaries, is the motivation for writing enclitics with hyphens.1
Several enclitics, =ata, =atam, =tanem, and
=tang, in pronunciation, may be regarded as particle
bases rather than enclitics, and this is reflected in
1

For a full discussion of the different sound contours at these
boundaries, see O. Miyaoka’s paper in Krauss 1985.

Enclitics
the fact that they are sometimes spelled with the
hyphen and sometimes as independent words.
Note that certain enclitics do occur as a part
of certain bases, often without their distinctive
boundary sound contours (and therefore written a
hyphen), and this is noted with “>” as, for example,
at the entry for =wa, is given “> cunawa, iciwa,
qayuwa, waniwa”. These particle bases are to be
found in the bases section of this dictionary.
Protoforms, if any, are given preceded “< PE
pb.” or “< PY pb.”, since the Comparative Eskimo
Dictionary (Fortescue et al. 1994) lists enclitics to=am used for emphasis or contrast in narrative

OLDER SOURCES

UNVERIFIED WORDS FROM OLDER SOURCES
In compiling this dictionary, all available older
vocabularies, wordlists, and dictionaries were consulted. Most of these are unpublished manuscripts.
Most of the words in these sources are still in use
and had already been included in the dictionary
files before the publication of the first edition in
1984. Other words were recognized from the old
sources by native speakers and, after being rewritten the modern orthography, were included in the
dictionary’s bases section. Some of the remaining
“mystery” words have been found in the Yup’ik
texts published since work on the first edition of
this dictionary was concluded, and so the modern
spellings of those words have been put in the present edition’s bases section and they have been removed from the lists of “mystery” words.
Some words in these sources, however, remain
mysterious. Either they still have not been recognized by the Yup’ik speakers who have been consulted, or, though recognized, they are not in areas
ascribed to them in the old sources. The lists in the
following section contain this residue (approximately 400 words), which cannot be included in
the bases section. Some might represent erroneous
elicitations,1 some that are recognizable from Inupiaq or Sugpiaq may have been elicited from bilinguals in one of those language and Central Yup’ik,2
some might represent actual Central Yup’ik words
with the meaning ascribed to them that simply
have not (yet) been verified,3 some represent words
1
See page xxiii of Grammatical Fundamentals of the Innuit
Language (Barnum 1901) concerning how the lack of a
mutual language or poor interpretation (or none) can lead
to this kind of error.
2
In the past, when most trade was entirely in native hands
and when English or even Russian did not serve at a lingua
franca, there were more cases of such bilingualism and more
cases of individuals or groups from on area living in another.
3
Several times recognizably the same items appears two
or more different lists with the same meaning ascribed to
it, and these certainly are good elicitations. They usually
cannot be accepted just on the basis of their presence in
these lists because their spellings there does not determine

that were indeed used at one time but have passed
out of use and perhaps out of the memory of all
living speakers, and others are simply so roughly
spelled that they cannot (or have not) been seen for
words that are already in the dictionary.
Further research might yield more information
about some of the remaining words on these lists;
someone might recognize them, provided they
have not passed out the memory of living speakers.
In some cases, however, they may never be recognized or explained.
In the lists here, words are given as they were
written, but with Cyrillic transliterated to Roman
characters. One should be aware that early writers employed orthographies very different from
today’s standard orthography, generally both underdifferentiating and overdifferentiating Yup’ik
sounds as well as being internally inconsistent.
Also, some of the lists were copied one or more
times, with errors undoubtedly creeping in at every stage. To get more of a sense of how each list’s
writer has represented the language, one should
consult (photocopies of) the full lists, which are
held by the Alaska Native Language Archives at
the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
The older sources (about 1820–1870) are often
of special interest because they give evidence of dialect change or movement of dialect traits over the
past 150 or more years. More information on present-day Yup’ik dialects can be found in the General
Introduction to this volume and in the book Yup’ik
Dialect Atlas and Study (Jacobson 1998).
Judging from the first known recorded vocabulary of Yup’ik by James King (see the frontispiece),
compiled on Captain Cook’s expedition of 1778, it
appears that the basic lexicon has changed little in
the area of Norton Sound and the mouth of the Yukon.4

Unverified Words
In contrast, the Yukon and Norton Sound case,
the old lists (Wrangell 1839, Orlov and Pinart 1871
from Bristol Bay (labeled “Aglurmiut,” a dialect
now restricted to Egegik5) and the Kuskokwim reveal certain words and traits strikingly like those
of present-day Nunivak in these places. Historical
accounts say — though somewhat confusedly —
that the “Aglurmiut” were formerly widespread
in the Kuskokwim and Bristol Bay, for a while coexisting alongside other Kuskokwim (and Bristol
Bay) Yup’ik people, and in general being replaced
(dialectically) by those other people everywhere
except in the general area of the north Alaska Peninsula, which is where Egegik is located. The word
lists back up the historical accounts. Concerning the
place of the Aglurmiut dialect, the writer of these
lines has written about it in detail in Yup’ik Dialect
Atlas and Study (Jacobson 1995:xv–xviii), and interested readers should consult those pages. The oldest source for Aglurmiut and the only early source
for Nunivak, Krhromchenko 1824, presents Nunivak as being closer to GCY than NUN is today, suggesting that perhaps Aglurmiut influence came to
Nunivak after that time. For example, akerta is given
for ’sun’ in Nunivak (as in modern GCY), whereas
puqlaneq is given for ’sun’ in Aglurmiut (as in modern NUN (and EG)). Iraluq is given for ’moon’ in
Nunivak (as in modern GCY (and EG)) rather than
tanqik, as in modern NUN and other early lists for
Aglurmiut and Kuskokwim. Evidently there has indeed been much movement of people, or at any rate
of dialects.
It remains to add here that the only early textual evidence of Aglurmiut, Sbornik Tserkovnykh Pesnopeniy i Molitvocloviy na Aglegmyutsko-Kuskokvimskom Narechiy (Russian Orthodox Church, 1896) and
Three Liturgical Gospel Readings (Orlov, 1897), which
clearly displays the diagnostic traits for EG,6 clearly
state these texts to be “Kuskokwim-Aglurmiut dialect.” Thus they show that indeed the Aglurmiut
dialect (now substantially EG) was formerly used
or known in the Kuskokwim as well, confirming

the evidence of the old lists.
An interesting example of language change
presented by these lists is a word for “eye” found
on two of the lists, Wrangell 1839 (as uitatek, ’eyes2’)
and Orlov-Pinart 1871 (as uitassuutegka, ’my eyes2’),
both literally meaning ’devices2 for being openeyed’, from uite- ’to open the eyes’. Despite the fact
that this word has not been verified, its occurrence
on two lists gives credence to it. It is similar to other descriptive instrumentals used for anatomical
terms in core GCY. In fact, a similarly formed term,
uitsat, is used in East Greenlandic Eskimo.7

causes an interruption in the Norton Sound dialect (see
Yup’ik Dialect Atlas and Study (Jacobson 1998:xv), but in as
much as this movement brought words and traits into the
area rather than out of the area, there is no positive evidence
of a dialect pattern for Norton Sound different from that of
the present in the old lists.

See General Introduction footnotes on the EG dialect.

East Greenlandic, like core GCY, is prime ground for
evidence of name-of-deceased taboo word substitution.

KHROMCHENKO 1824
The “Aglegmute” and Nunivak lists are explicity attributed to Adol’f Karlovich Ètolin in a manuscript by K. T.
Khlebnikov (1830), but because they have been published in various editions (see bibliography) as the work of
Khromchenko, they are cited here under the latter’s name.
The original list by Khromchenko contains 135 Russian items with Yup’ik equivalents from three areas. Eleven
remain unidentified or otherwise unenterable in the main section.

APPENDIX 3
DEMONSTRATIVES
A demonstrative indicates an entity by its spatial or temporal relationship to the speaker. Yup’ik has both
demonstrative pronouns and demonstrative adverbs. The demonstrative pronouns are marked for case
and number, as other nouns are, but not for possessor; they may be substituted for nouns, except that they
cannot be used with most of the postbases that attach to noun bases. Demonstrative adverbs, on the other
hand, are marked only for those cases involving spatial or movement orientation; they indicate the area
from, at, through, or to which the action of the verb occurs.
Demonstrative adverbs are formed from the corresponding demonstrative pronouns, although not always
in a predictable or regular way. Demonstratives have their own system of inflection, shown in the tables in
the following pages. For most demonstratives there are vocative forms, used for gaining a user’s attention,
and interjectional forms, used to call attention to an area. These forms are also given in the tables.
Demonstrative pronouns in their absolutive singular forms, and demonstrative adverbs in their localis
forms, are listed alphabetically in the Bases section of the dictionary. In their relationships to one another,
the demonstratives form a system about which one can learn much by seeing them arrayed together, as
on the chart on the following page. In this chart we list first the demonstrative pronoun in its absolutive
singular form, then, separated by a slash (/), the corresponding demonstrative adverb in its localis form.
In the chart the first vertical column, labeled extended, consists of the demonstratives that are used to refer
to an entity or area that is in sight and that is extended to some length, moving from one place to another,
or of broad expanse. The extended demonstratives may be characterized as those that refer to an entity or
area that requires more than a single glance to be seen. The second column, labeled restricted, includes the
demonstratives that refer to an entity or area that is in sight and that is restricted in size and is not in motion (or whose motion is confined to a restricted area). In other words, restricted demonstratives refer to
an entity or area that may be seen fully in a single glance. The third column, labled obscured, includes the
demonstratives that refer to an entity or area that is either not in sight or not clearly perceptible.
Each horizontal row gives the extended, restricted, and obscured demonstratives for each distinct area with
respect to the speaker (e.g., ’above’, ’below’, etc.). The reader will note that the form of the demonstratives
is largely related to their position on the chart. In addition, the rows pair off according to the first letter of
the demonstratives in these rows (especially in the obscured column).
Each pair of rows in the chart below consists of one row (labeled ’a’) that is relatively more accessible to
the speaker and another row (labeled ’b’), which is relatively less accessible to the speaker. The first pair of
rows (I) are demonstratives oriented according to the dimension of ’closer to the speaker (more accessible)
vs. closer to the listener (less accessible)’. The second pair (II) are oriented to the dimension of ’over (more

963

Appendices
accessible) vs. across (less accessible)’. The third pair (III) are oriented to the dimension of ’inside or upriver
(more accessible) vs. outside (less accessible)’. The fourth pair (IV) are oriented to the dimension of ’down
below or down the slope (more accessible) vs. downriver or toward the exit (less accessible)’. The fifth pair
(V) are oriented to the dimension of ’up the slope (more accessible) vs. up above (less accessible)’.

In addition to these demonstratives, there are several that do not fit well in the chart. They are ukna/ukani
’the one coming/toward here’, imna ’the aforementioned one’, kina ’who, someone’, and nani ’where,
somewhere’.
The following diagrams illustrate the use of the demonstratives. They also illustrate associations of demonstratives and verbs of motion, and relationships that cut across the pairings shown in the chart above.
In these diagrams, demonstratives are given only in the terminalis case of the adverbial forms, though other
cases and/or pronomial forms could have been used with certain adjustments. The restricted forms of the
demonstratives are given first, followed in parentheses by the extended and obscured forms.
Figure 1 shows a cross-sectional view up a slope. Pikavet, etc., is ’toward the area up above’, while piavet,
etc., is ’up the slope’. Note that the verbs of motion associated with these directions are different. Mayurluni, associated with pikavet, is ’going up above’, while tagluni, associated with piavet, is ’going up
the slope’. On the other hand, a single demonstrative group, kanavet, etc., is used for either ’toward the
area down below’ or ’down the slope’, and likewise one verb of motion, atrarluni, is used for ’going down
(either way)’.
Figure 2 is a bird’s-eye view showing a river and its mouth, while Figure 3 is a bird’s-eye view of a house
and its door. The demonstrative uavet, etc., is used for ’toward the mouth of a river’ (Figure 2) and ’toward
the door’ (Figure 3); its associated verbs are anelrarluni ’going toward the mouth of the river’ and the relative form anluni ’going out the door’ (and thus anluni also goes with the demonstrative group keggavet,

etc., ’toward outside’). The demonstrative group kiavet, etc., means ’inland or upriver’ (Figure 2) and ’inside or in the door’ (Figure 3); its associated verbs of motion are itrarluni and iterluni respectively, related
to each other in form. Note that in Figure 2 the downslope, toward-the-river aspect of kanavet is repeated
from Figure 1, as is piavet, upslope.
Figure 4 illustrates the difference between the demonstrative group yaavet, etc., ’toward over there, but not
across something’, with the verb agluni ’going over’, and the demonstrative group ikavet, etc., ’toward the
other side of a river, road, fence, etc.’, with the verb qerarluni ’crossing over’ or the verb ayagluni ’departing’.

Dialect Variations in Reference to the Following Inflectional Charts
NI uses keggna, pikeggna, and ukeggna rather than ikna, pikna, and ukna.
NS and HBC use tavani, tavavet, etc., where v between a’s is [w], rather than tuani, tuavet, etc.
HS and NUN use iini, iivet, etc., piini, piivet, etc., and qiini, qiivet, etc., rather than agaani, agaavet,
etc., pagaani, pagaavet, etc., and qagaani, qagaavet, etc.
HBC and some Y form vocatives with -yuug rather than -suuq (except after a stop consonant), for example forming uyuuq and ingyuuq rather than usuuq and ingsuuq.
NSU uses augna, paugna, and qaugna rather than a¥gna, pa¥gna, and qa¥gna.
NSU uses the prefix ta- (tas- before a consonant) for emphasis or repeated reference with all demonstratives, and not just with man’a, una, maani, and wani (giving tamana, tauna, tamaani, and tavani
or tuani) as in the rest of Yup’ik. For example, from ingna, akmani, pikna, and qavani NSU can form
taingna, taakmani, taspikna, and tasqavani. Somewhat unpredictable are taingani or tasiani from
yaani (underlyingly *ingani), taun’a from un’a, taagani from iini (underlyingly *agani), taugani from
uani (underlyingly *ugani), and taugna from augna (and the identical form from ugna).
HBC has lenis v, that is, [w] (see dialect section of General Introduction), only in demonstrative adverbs
such as avani, qavani, pavani, and tavani, and for this reason HBC speakers often prefer to write these

APPENDIX 4
POSITIONAL BASES

Positional bases are a group of noun bases that do not normally appear without a possessed ending (or
special postbase for this kind of base). They denote areas with respect to the possessors. Thus qulii means
‘the area above it’. Despite the fact that the sytstem of positional bases parallels that of the demonstratives to a large extent, positionals are not related in form to demonstratives.
Following is a complete list of positional bases:
aci- area below
aki- area opposite
akule- area between
cani- area beside
ciu- area at the front (with reference to boats, time, etc.)
elate- area outside
ilu- area inside
kelu- area back from water
kete- area toward water
kingu- area at the back (with reference to boats, time, etc.)
manu- area in front of or at the front (with reference to person)
pai- area at the mouth (with reference to rivers, etc.)
qai- area on the surface
qule- area above
tunge- area toward
tunu- area behind or at the back (with reference to person)
In addition, positional bases can be formed from many of the demonstratives by attaching the postbase
+te- to the demonstrative adverb base. Thus from the demonstrative avani ‘over there’ comes avate-/
‘area over there (with respect to possessor), area around possessor’.

APPENDIX 5
LISTS OF ROOTS BY TYPE
As discussed in the General Introduction, a root is like a base but cannot be used with an ending to form a
word unless one of a certain set of postbases is used between the root and the ending, or between the root
and other postbases. Roots are listed here by type as described in the General Introduction.

Deep Roots
at- below, down
ku- flow of liquids
na- lack of knowledge

pu- swelling
qa- vocalizing
tu- impact

Dimensional Roots
The items listed below and marked with * are not strictly roots, as they can function as ordinary nouns,
but they are grouped here with the dimensional roots because they take the postbases normally used with
dimensional roots. Some “dimensional” concepts such as size or weight are not listed here because in
Yup’ik these are not expressed by roots or bases taking dimensional root postbases.
aki- value*
akur- length of a garment*
amel- width, especially of a creek
cace(t)-, cas- (also taces-) fortitude
cug- (also sug-) human height
elur- (also lur-) width, especially of a garment
ilu- interior capacity or size*
imar- capacity*
iq- width
kanag- leg length
lur- (also elur-) width, especially of a garment
mam- thickness
mar- length, distance overland
mig- loudness of a thudding noise

mis- perceptibility
marrlu- depth of a net
nequ- width
qas- loudness
qecig- thickness of a skin, cloth, etc.*
qer-, qur- height
sug- (also cug-) human height
taces- (also cacet-) fortitude
tume- foot length*
tuner- impact
umyuar- mental ability*
usvi-, uyvi- wisdom, cleverness*
uya- width, especially of a river*

974

Appendices
Emotional Roots
The items listed below and marked with * are not strictly roots, as they can function as ordinary verbs
with the given form being used instead of the normal combination of emotional root and postbase
+~ yug-; otherwise, they behave as emotional roots. Note that some “emotional” concepts, such as being
angry, are not listed here, because in Yup’ik these are not expressed by roots or bases that take emotionalroot postbases.
aar- frightened, endangered
alag- finding something feasible
alia-, alai- lonely
ancurtu(r)- hesitant*
asgura- doubting
augtar- inhibited
canga- disliking

tunrir- beholden*
tuvqa- generous
ucur- praising
ukver- believing*
ulurya- afraid of being hit
uumi- frustrated

975

Appendices
Postural Roots

Bases section). Some “postural” roots, such as rising, are not listed here because in Yup’ik they are not
expressed by postural roots.
inar- lying down
irir- tilting sideways
isser- undressed
itum- breaking*
kalug- empty
kamilar- barefoot
kanar- bending forward
katur- gathering

APPENDIX 10
LOAN WORDS
pan, soap, candle, cup, spoon, watch, eyeglasses,
and matches; for articles of clothing, such as coat,
shoes, scarf, suspenders, and socks; and for types
of boats, such as steamboat, scow, and ship. There
are religious terms, such as ikon, nun, cross, censer,
Christmas, and Easter. The term for ‘white person’,
kass’aq, is from the Russian word that becomes
‘Cossack’ in English. On the other hand, there are
objects that the Russians introduced for which
words were created from native Yup’ik sources; for
example, the Yup’ik word for ‘saw’, kegglaq, and
for ‘priest’, agayulirta, are not borrowed from Russian.
Most of the loan words are basically nouns.
Predictably, Russian loan words are most common in areas of greatest Russian activity, such as
Bristol Bay, the Nushagak River, Lake Iliamna,
the upper Kuskokwim, and the Yukon. But even
areas such as Hooper Bay and Chevak, the lower
Kuskokwim, Nelson Island, and Nunivak Island,
which had less contact with Russians, still use a
great many of these loan words.
All these loan words have entered the Yup’ik
language to the extent that they do not incorporate
any sounds not previously present in Yup’ik. Russian apical r, for example, becomes l in Yup’ik; Russian o became u, as can be seen in Alussistuaq, the
loan word for ‘Christmas’ from Russian Rozhdestvo.
Nevertheless, Russian loans tend to be phonologically distinctive in Yup’ik in a number of ways.
Russian loans have few back velars, except q or aq,
which have been added to the ends of many Russian words to make them acceptable Yup’ik nouns.
Loan words have a high frequency of long vowels,
as in luuskaaq ‘spoon’ and yaassiik ‘box’. They

Yup’ik has about three hundred and fifty loan
words, mainly from Russian. A Yup’ik word is considered a loan word from another language if it
is used by Yup’ik speakers who do not know that
other language, as is the case with loans from Russian, or if, as in the case of loans from English, it
has entered Yup’ik to the extent that it has a generally agreed-upon Yup’ik pronunciation that differs
from its English pronunciation, even for those who
speak both languages.
Russian Loan Words
Yup’ik has about two hundred and ten loan
words from Russian. Many are in common use in
all Yup’ik areas; for example, caarralaq or saarralaq ‘sugar’. Others, words for uncommon things
or words for which there are native Yup’ik equivalents, are quite uncommon; examples are the loan
words al’tuutaq ‘mercury’ and tupuuluq ‘axe’. The
word for ‘mercury’ is probably restricted to the upper Kuskokwim, where there was a cinnabar (mercury ore) mine; the word tupuuluq is less commonly used than the native words for ‘axe’, piqertuutaq
and qalqapak. On the other hand, some Russian
loan words are more common in many areas than
the native Yup’ik words for the same things; for example, the Russian word luuskaaq ‘spoon’ is more
common in most areas than the native Yup’ik word
for ‘spoon’, uiluq.
There are Russian loan words for imported food
items, such as flour, bread, butter, pepper, shortening, coffee, and tea; for domesticated animals such
as cat, horse, cow, pig, and chicken; for household and personal items such as table, lock, dish-

often begin with sounds or sound combinations
that are not very common in native Yup’ik words,
for example l as in lumarraq ‘cloth, shirt’, c or s as
in caayuq/saayuq ‘tea’, pel or kel as in pelatekaq
‘tent’ and kelucaq ‘lock’, or esk or est as in eskuulutaq ‘frying pan’ and estuuluq ‘table’. The e
in estuuluq (and in the three examples preceding
it) is a Yup’ik addition to prevent an initial two-consonant cluster, but some Yup’ik speakers will allow
loan words to begin with an sk or st cluster, saying
for example stuuluq, although this goes against the
normal Yup’ik pattern. Some loan words have the
second consonant geminated, which is relatively
uncommon in native Yup’ik nouns, for example the
loan words kass’aq ‘white person’ and cap’akiq/
sap’akiq ‘shoe’. There may be a long vowel in a
closed syllable, for example pula’avkaq ‘safety
pin’, an uncommon occurrence in non-loans. Furthermore, some loan words have gemination before a long vowel but after a vowel, which would
otherwise be rhythmically lengthened. This pattern occurs very rarely in native Yup’ik words but
(fortunately) can be dealt with in the orthography.
Examples are mulut’uuk ‘hammer’, kuluk’uunaq
‘bell’, malagg’aayaq ‘fur hat’, and pelit’aaq ‘stove’.
Each of these unusual sound patterns in Yup’ik is
an attempt to replicate the sound pattern of the
Russian original.
Russian loan words often have several forms
or variants in different regions. In particular, many
may begin with either c or s and may have either
short or long vowels; for example, ‘cup’ may be caskaq, caaskaq, caskaaq, saskaq, or saaskaq. In case
of initial c/s, NI, HBC, and NUN always use the c
variant, while K and BB use the s variant; Y and NS
use both, generally following the original Russian.
Some words have both p-initial and m-initial variants, for example pilu’uvkaaq, and milu’uvkaq
‘rope’, or both p-initial and k-initial forms, as
puukic’aaq and kuukic’aaq ‘button’, and cases in
which sounds have been reversed, as in cukunaq
and kucunaq ‘cast-iron kettle’. There is at least one
case in which a Russian word has come into Yup’ik
in several forms, as in muluk’uuq and malak’uuq
‘milk’ (which come from different dialects of Russian).

Some of the words are from archaic or Siberian
Russian and are not now, or never were, in widespread Russian use. Words for things that are normally non-singular came from Russian plurals. In
the list of Russian loan words, the words are presented according to the Russian alphabetical order of the source words. Transcription follows the
Board of Geographic Names system.
Non-Russian Loan Words
Though the majority of loans in Yup’ik are from
Russian, there are a number of loans from other
languages from English, Aleut, Sugpiaq, Inupiaq,
Chukchi and/or Koryak and/or Kamchadal, Athabascan, Saami (Lapp), and Philippine languages.
About seventy words from English have been
fully incorporated into Yup’ik, with their phonology adjusted to make them suitable for Yup’ik. Examples are piipiq ‘baby’ and patituussaaq ‘potato’.
Other English loans are partially incorporated,
with their phonology adjusted, partially adjusted,
or not adjusted at all, depending on the speaker using them. Thus, the English word ‘radio’ may be
used in Yup’ik as liitiuq, 3iitiuq (with only the initial 3 as in English), or as radio-q (with the word
pronounced as in English up to the q). Only fully
incorporated words such as piipiq have been included as entries in this dictionary. The list of loans
from English should be understood to be somewhat
arbitrarily compiled, as for different Yup’ik speakers the list would undoubtedly be different, and
since Yup’ik is in contact with English, the list of
English words being incorporated into Yup’ik is in
fact open ended.
Thirty Yup’ik words are borrowings from Aleut.
Some loans, for example those for ‘liquor’, ‘tea’,
‘sleeve’, and ‘gunsight’, were probably introduced
to the Yup’iks via Aleuts near the time of arrival in
Alaska of the Russians; the rest probably entered
Yup’ik prior to the Russians’ arrival. Half the Aleut
loans are narrowly restricted in use to the Egegik
dialect of Yup’ik, near the Aleut area. One may notice the large number of fish and game names from
Aleut.
There are about ten words from Sugpiaq, all in

it is not present in Siberian Yupik, or it may have
been introduced through the Aleutian chain by native Siberians working for the Russians (this word
is present in Aleut and Sugpiaq).
Five loans are from Athabascan, and these are
fish and game words used in inland Yup’ik. Several
words from Philippine languages have been identified. These words are used only in the Bristol Bay
area, where they are presumed to have been introduced by Filipino cannery workers around 1900.
One Saami (or Lapp) loan has been found; it
deals with reindeer herding. A number of Saami
came to the Yup’ik areas around 1900 to set up a
reindeer-herding industry. A specific “Lapp game”
and a specific style of “Lapp boots” are well known
but are referred to in English.
In addition to the identified loans, a number
of words appear to be loans, because of either or
both their phonology and their semantic content,
but their source has not been found (see list). In the
following lists, the Yup’ik is translated only if the
translation differs from that given for the source
word.

Egegik, largely fish and game names.
Thirty words are known to have been borrowed
from Inupiaq, and several of these are ultimately
from Athabascan. Most of them are confined to
the Norton Sound Unaqliq dialect contiguous with
Inupiaq territory, and only a few are found south
of that area. The Inupiaq loans used in the Unaliq
region of Norton Sound include several words in
which an Inupiaq apical 3 has been borrowed, for
example, aa3iga’ar- ‘to be good, nice’. This has set
a (minor) precedent for the use of apical 3 in loans
from English in that area.
Four loans are from the native languages of
eastern Siberia, Chukchi, Koryak, and Kamchadal.
These are kuingiq ‘pipe, cigarette’, qusngiq/quyngiq ‘reindeer’ (and by extension ‘sheep’, through
the use of the word for a sheep-like domestic animal in the Yup’ik translation of the New Testament), and kalikaq ‘paper’. The first two of these,
kuingiq and qusngiq, were probably introduced
across the Bering Strait by native traders, as these
words are also present in Siberian Yupik. Kalikaq
may also have been introduced in this way, though

used here because they are pan-Eskimo stories. Either Yup’ik versions of them have not been published
(UNP1 and UNP3), or they represent a dialect from which nothing else has been published (UNP2).

ENGLISH-TO-YUP’IK INDEX

1014

ENGLISH-TO-YUP’IK INDEX
This index is an alphabetical list of English
words and phrases used as translations of the
Yup’ik dictionary entries and of lexicalized phrases
of two (or more) words given in small capital letters
within an entry.1 The index gives the Yup’ik entry
or entries in which the English word in question is
used in the gloss. However, this is not itself meant to
be a full English-to-Yup’ik dictionary section. This
index does not tell which dialect or dialects use that
word, how a word is used grammatically, or the
precise range of its meaning. Therefore, the person
seeking a suitable Yup’ik translation for a given
English word should, after looking up the English
word in this section, then look up in the Yup’ikto-English sections each Yup’ik word or postbase
listed here for the English word in question.2
For example, quite a few Yup’ik bases and
postbases are listed here for ‘give’.3 Some of
these mean ‘to give as a permanent possession’
(as in English ‘he will give him hunting knife
for Christmas’), while other mean ‘to give for
temporary or immediate use’ (as in English ‘give me
the butter knife’), and still others mean ‘to give’ in a
1

For example, nuna pektuq ‘earthquake’, is found with the entry
for nuna ‘land, village’, also the entry for pekte- ‘to move’.

2

The only case in which this index could properly be used without
consulting the Yup’ik-to-English sections is when one is merely
trying to jog one’s memory about a Yup’ik word one already know.

3

The word ‘to’ of infinitives is systematically omitted from the
English verb entries in this index, even though it appears in glosses
of verbs in the Yup’ik-to-English sections.

more specialized sense. One can see that in a given
context it would be a mistake to use the wrong verb
for ‘to give’. Also some of these verbs have the thing
given as the grammatical object and the recipient
expressed by a noun in a certain oblique case, while
others have the recipient as the grammatical object
and the thing given by an oblique case noun. To get
this sort of information, one must go the Yup’ik-toEnglish section.
Because no attempt has been made in this
English-to-Yup’ik index to list all English words
and give (or create) Yup’ik equivalents or possible
equivalents, one may have to look under other
English words similar in meaning or otherwise
related to the one wanted. For example, to find a
Yup’ik word for ‘courageous’, one may have to look
under ‘brave’ or ‘fearless’, or perhaps under ‘afraid’
and ‘not’. Yup’ik equivalents of English words
such as ‘a’, ‘the’, ‘in’, ‘from’, ‘will’, and so forth are
expressed through grammatical constructions, for
which one should see Practical Grammar of … Yup’ik
(Jacobson 1995) or another Yup’ik Eskimo grammar.
Often the index will lead one to a Yup’ik word
that is not the same part of speech as the English
word sought. For example, under ‘headache’ one
finds Yup’ik verb bases for ‘to have a headache’;
a Yup’ik noun meaning ‘headache’ would have to
form the verb together with a postbase meaning
‘state of V-ing’ or ‘result of V-ing’. In many cases
one must use the Yup’ik-to-English section and
knowledge of, and facility with, the grammar of

1015

English-to-Yup’ik Index
the language to form proper and suitable Yup’ik
words, phrases, and sentences; this English-toYup’ik index alone is insufficient.
After an English index entry, first the various
Yup’ik bases for that English word are listed, then
the Yup’ik postbases (and enclitics) after the bases.
Postbases are given without any parenthesized
initial letters (the same way that they are
alphabetized in the postbase section). Postbase
entries are indicated with “(pb)” and an initial
hyphen (whatever the actual suffixation pattern
of the postbase), and enclitic entries are indicated
with “enc.” and an initial equals sign. “(n)” in
an English entry indicates “noun”, and “(v)”
indicates “verb”.
After the bases and postbases may be references
such as see Zagoskin or see Drebert; these refer one to
the “Lists of Unidentified Words from Old Sources,”
indicating that there is a form in that list translated

by the English word in question.
If there are two or more variants of a Yup’ik
word listed in a single entry in the Yup’ik-to-English
section, then only the first is given in this index.
Likewise, if the Yup’ik entry has a noun and verb
together, then only the noun form is given in this
index. Also, only Yup’ik words that appear at the
head of the entries are indexed, not derived words
occurring in examples.4
A tilde, “~”, in the index entry refers back
to the word(s) of the entry before the colon. For
example, ‘be ~ again’ in an index entry ‘hungry: be
~ again’, should be read as ‘be hungry again’.
There are also topical entries for types of
terminology, such as for “legendary animals,
monsters, and half-humans”, “legendary heroes
and villains”, “constellations”, and “indigenous
holiday”.

4

An exception being lexicalized multiword phrases (in small
capitals in the examples part of (usually) all relevant entries. Thus
looking up ‘hangnail’ in the index, one will find cetuum ciutii,
which to found in the entries for both cetuk ‘fingernail’, and ciun
‘ear’.
Items ending with hyphen are verbs. Items beginning with hyphen are postbases. Items beginning with equals sign are enclitics.
